Overall evaluation

Stream framerate is not stable over different connection sessions, average framerate is about 32 fps.
The ROS calculation does not affect framerate nor performance when processing image to display it.
The ROS calculation does not affect framerate nor performance when timing and displaying the image.
The ROS calculation does not affect framerate nor performance when processing image to display it with face detection algorithm.
The ROS calculation heavily affect framerate and performance when processing image to display it with projected pointcloud (about 18% of curl fps).
